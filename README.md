# Disease-Prediction

a web-based disease prediction system that uses machine learning to analyze symptoms and provide potential disease predictions. The system allows users to input their symptoms through a web interface, which are then processed by a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. The classifier calculates the probability of each disease given the symptoms and selects the disease with the highest probability as the predicted disease. The system aims to facilitate early disease detection and informed decision-making for improved treatment outcomes.
